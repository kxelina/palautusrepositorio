A quick and effective method for gathering team feedback is the "Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of" wheel. Team members evaluate an iteration or milestone using five categories in a 10-to 25-minute session: start, stop, continue, more of, and less of. A facilitator encourages conversations on which tasks to initiate ("start"), remove ("stop"), maintain ("continue"), increase ("more of"), or reduce ("less of") using a group of people divided into different sections on a poster. In each section, participants leave comments that encourage open-ended feedback. These comments are noted by the facilitator on the poster. Subgroups within larger groups focused on particular aspects, creating unique posters. There is a plenary discussion after that that includes further information from other posters. The meeting ends with decisions made regarding the team's next iteration, milestone, and project.
